Instructions from our report:

*The app is very easy to use and fairly straightforward. On first startup you are presented with the initialisation screen. One has to fill in the cards and submit them as long as the app keeps presenting new cards. This will calibrate the difficulty to ones abilities and afterwards switch to the home menu. There the user is presented with two options: general learning and learning by topic. The first option will lead to a page with ten cards that are not grouped by topic. The second will first lead to a list with topics (and the progress for each) and upon selecting one opens a similar page with cards as described before. This page shows up to ten cards which can be of two varieties: a training card or a test card. These cards have both a front and back side. The card can be flipped by tapping it. The front shows an English word and the back of training card shows a Dutch word to be memorised by the user and the testing card shows a text field in which the user has to fill in the correct translation. If the user needs more information an information screen can be found in the main menu.*
